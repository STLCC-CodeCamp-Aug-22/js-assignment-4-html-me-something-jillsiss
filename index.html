               <h2>Sports Games</h2>
               <p>
                  Sports games were the first kind of video games I remember playing. I had an older brother so my gaming selection was entirely made up of what he didn't play anymore. Picture a young girl, with no football knowledge whatsoever, playing a madden game with an outdated roster for hours on end. If one of the games had the option to customize a player, my playtime would double.

               <h2>Tony Hawk</h2>
               <p>
                  Stemming from my love of sports games, the Tony Hawk series was my next obsession. Another choice selction from my brother's library, I played the story modes over and over again. The soundtrack was amazing, the worlds were mesmerizing, the movement felt sensational. At this point, character creation was my favorite part of any game. Making a new custom skater every playthrough let me play these games over and over again.

               <h2>Fuzion Frenzy</h2>
               <p>
                  My first multiplayer experience, Fuzion Frenzy was an absolute gem for local splitscreen. It was a party game for up to four people, so it always came out if my siblings all played together. This game still has the potential to start a war among my loved ones, which I believe only shows its quality.

               <h2>World of Warcraft</h2>
               <p>
                  Now we're talking about character creation. This came in at a perfect time for me to drop everything and live my life on this MMORPG. I had multiple alternative charcters as I could never commit to just one. My main charcter, however, was always a blood elf. Customization was the huge draw for me in this game, but I ended up loving a lot of different things about it. I loved the openness of a huge world. While my parents didn't let me at time, being able to communicate with other players online seemed so futuristic. This was also the first game I got to play with a friend that wasn't splitscreen.

               <h2>Left 4 Dead</h2>
               <p>
                  I played the first Left 4 Dead game many times. I was a big fan of the zombie survival genre at the time, and L4D was perfect. When Left 4 Dead 2 came out, there were a lot of new modes to play, but only if you had xbox live. I had never had it before, but I was in love with the series. It was then that I got my first xbox live membership, and ventured into the world of online multiplayer gaming. Good luck.

               <h2>Call of Duty</h2>
               <p>
                  My first Call of Duty was Modern Warfare 2. I had a lot of fun playing it with my friends and decided to get Black Ops 2 when it came out. From then on, every day after school in 8th grade, I'd play Black Ops 2. Every spare moment I had was devoted to getting the next prestige, or trying to get a diamond camo for my guns. I'd be grinding in multiplayer all day, but in silence. Unfortunately, this is also where I discovered voice chat was not for me. At the time, being a tweenage girl in a Call of Duty lobby apparently meant you deserved a lot of vile comments. That was the end of online gaming for me for a while.
